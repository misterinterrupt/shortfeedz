The goal of this project is twofold. 

It will be a short url mechanism for realtime twitter streams.

On the way to creating this, It will fill the requirements of this challenge:

-------   -------   -------   -------   -------   -------
Twitter Feed Real-Time Parser Problem 
description
Build a twitter feed reader following these specifications and guidelines:

   * Server/NodeJS: lookup Twitter feeds or topics via Twitter API and 
   * display them in the frontend in real-time. 
   * Should be able to retain the state of the users requests in memory, 
      * i.e. if the user adds one feed, then another, the two feeds should be stored so 
      * the user can subsequently switch between them. 
      * Multiple feeds or topics are merged inline, not split in to two separate timelines.

   * Client: option to look up new feeds or topics and 
   * receive updates in real time. 
   * Should be able to add and remove feeds up watch updates in real time.
We would like you to use NodeJS and jQuery and write the entire application in javascript, HTML and CSS. You can use 3rd party libraries for NodeJS, but the only one allowed client-side is jQuery.
It should be possible to use the backend from the command line as well as the frontend. The solution will be graded on modularity, extensibility and readability.


These requirements are filled at the completion of what is currently the user accounts page.
After signing in to Twitter, one can create and modify Twitter search streams. 
These streams can be selected for viewing in real time.
